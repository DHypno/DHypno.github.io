        <h1>About MELT</h1>
      </div>

      <p>Most people who need mental health support aren't getting what they need from traditional approaches. If that's you, MELT might help.</p>
      <p>It's not therapy, but it's designed to be therapeutic. MELT meets you where you are and only goes as deep as you're ready to go. It helps you understand your own internal mental landscape without all the cultural noise - translating your thoughts back to you so they actually make sense.</p>
      <p>When you can see your mind clearly, improving the parts of your life that hold you back becomes way easier. You've always been capable - you just needed clarity.</p>
      <p>No therapy-speak. No fixing. No agenda. Your conversations stay private (we don't even ask for your name).</p>
      <p><em>(MELT isn't therapy and can't handle emergencies. If you're in danger or thinking about self-harm, call emergency services or a crisis hotline immediately.)</em></p>
