  <h1>MELT – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective: August 24, 2025 • Last updated: August 24, 2025</p>

  <p>MELT is built to respect your privacy while giving you a helpful reflective companion. This policy explains what we collect, why, and the choices you have.</p>

  <h2>Who we are</h2>
  <p>Bell Studios (“we”, “us”). Contact: <a href="mailto:support@bellstudios.io">support@bellstudios.io</a></p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account basics:</strong> MELT is designed to be as private as possible, we don't even ask for your name! However, there are a few paths where data can travel, here's what is collected: IF you link a login, we store your email and provider (e.g., Google) to keep your data across devices. If you aren't logged in/anonymous, you will have an anonymous ID through Firebase that will be stored instead.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage counters:</strong> Daily message count/limits per tier.</li>
    <li><strong>Conversation data (depends on tier):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Free:</em> no messages are stored.</li>
        <li><em>Mirror:</em> no full messages stored; we store lightweight metadata (recent snippet, inferred topic/emotion, counts). This is to help the model build off of your nuance.</li>
        <li><em>Mind:</em> full thread history is stored in Firebase (messages, timestamps, and optional topic/emotion tags). This is for FULL nuance and content optimization across threads.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Device info:</strong> basic app/OS diagnostics to keep the service reliable (crash logs, performance). We do not collect precise location.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The only reason data is used is to deliver MELT’s features, show your threads (Mind), and maintain rolling context (Mirror).</li>
    <li>To enforce fair-use limits and prevent abuse.</li>
    <li>To improve quality and reliability (aggregated, non-identifying analytics).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How processing works</h2>
  <p>MELT uses third-party processors to provide functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> authentication, Firestore database, and related infrastructure. This would consist of your user ID (Anonomous/Email) as well as any applicable metadata as outlined above.</li>
    <li><strong>AI model provider(s):</strong> Your prompts and necessary context are sent to model APIs to generate replies. We do not allow providers to use your data to train on by default, and we select settings that disable training where available.</li>
    <li><strong>Payments (when enabled):</strong> App store billing (Google Play / Apple App Store). We do not receive your full payment details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Free:</em> no message storage.</li>
    <li><em>Mirror:</em> rolling metadata persists to help continuity.</li>
    <li><em>Mind:</em> messages persist until you delete a thread or your account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your choices & rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Export:</strong> Email <a href="mailto:support@bellstudios.io">support@bellstudios.io</a> from your login email and we’ll provide your data (Mind threads + metadata).</li>
    <li><strong>Delete:</strong> You can delete threads inside the app (Mind). You can request full account deletion via email.</li>
    <li><strong>Unlink:</strong> You can continue anonymously; linked accounts enable sync across devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>MELT is for users 18+ (or the minimum age in your country). We do not knowingly collect data from users under that age.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use modern security controls (Firebase security rules, HTTPS, access controls). No system can be 100% secure; report issues to <a href="mailto:support@bellstudios.io">support@bellstudios.io</a>.</p>

  <h2>International transfers</h2>
  <p>Data may be processed in the United States or other regions where our processors host services.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We’ll post updates here and update the “Last updated” date. Material changes may be announced in-app or by email (if linked).</p>
