      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p><strong>PUZL</strong> is designed to be simple, safe, and respectful of user privacy.</p>

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>

  <li>Advertising identifiers (if ads are enabled)</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase verification data (if you make an in-app purchase or subscribe to PUZL Pro)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This information is used solely to operate, maintain, and improve the app experience.</p>

<h4>Third-Party Services</h4>
<p>PUZL uses the following third-party services:</p>
